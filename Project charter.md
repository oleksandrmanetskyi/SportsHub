# Constraints

**Budget**

The budget may focus on essential expenses such as development costs, hosting fees, domain registration, and minimal marketing expenses.

**Time**

The project timeline may be shorter, with a focus on rapid development and deployment to minimize time-to-market.
Shorter development sprints or agile iterations may be employed to deliver incremental updates and improvements within a compressed timeframe.

Quality assurance efforts may be more streamlined, focusing on essential functionality and usability testing rather than comprehensive testing across all devices and browsers.
Automated testing tools and manual testing by a smaller team may be utilized to identify and address critical issues efficiently.

**Scope**

The project scope may be narrower, focusing on core features and functionalities essential for launching.
Additional features or advanced functionalities may be deferred to future iterations or updates based on user feedback and resource availability.
